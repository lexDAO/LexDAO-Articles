# Breakdown of Modes

Legal writing, especially legislation has their unique traits [^1], mostly grounded around arguments (there's a reason why its a squabble of legal engineers). When combined with software which is primarily expository (internal [easter eggs](http://catb.org/jargon/html/E/Easter-egg.html) aside) you will develop Scribe lvl 2+ skills and (hopefully) emerge with your own thought leadership (scribe lvl 3+) with signature visual style (xref RSAnimate series). Our concern is the _truth_ (or closest facsimile given distance of time and deliberate [obfuscation](https://www.inc-aus.com/kit-eaton/ftc-accuses-amazons-jeff-bezos-of-using-signals-disappearing-messages-for-discussing-competition.html)) so we leave descriptive hyperbole to hallucinary AI.

## Argument Map

This is a formal way to structure an argument along with the evidentary common pool (your opponent can draw upon the same evidence only with "reinterpretation" to fit their fact-patterns).

## Analytical

LexDAO we train up critical thinking skills so you can (naturally) destroy your critics in a battle of wits. This can only be done by exercising your skills and spotting flaws (or fallacies) in others.

### Timeline (also depository)

  commit id: "time" tag: "on or around date ..."
  commit id: "location"
  commit id: "event 1"
  branch alleged
    commit id: "event 2"
    commit id: "event 3"
    commit id: "event 4"
    branch witness
      commit id: "event 4"
  checkout main
    commit id: "conclude"
    merge witness

## Hypothetical

A well designed hypothetical is a delight, intended to test one's application of the law by slightly altering the fact patterns or jurisdiction. xref [TUNA]()
