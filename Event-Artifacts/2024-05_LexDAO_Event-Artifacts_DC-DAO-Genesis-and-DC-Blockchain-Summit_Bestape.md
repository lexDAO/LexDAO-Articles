## ETHDC genesis, Tuesday May 14 2024

I learned about ETH DC a week before the event. I was still in Roatan, Honduras after our https://lu.ma/Safe_Harbor event https://github.com/lexDAO/LexDAO-Articles/blob/master/Event-Artifacts/2024-05_LexDAO_Event-Artifacts_Safe-Harbor_Bestape.md , but quickly bought my flight to Baltimore.

There were definitely people at ETH DC I hadn't seen before, but there were also many familiar faces. It was a nice stepping stone between Ethereum culture and DC culture. More professionals there such as accountants and lawyers than most ETH events, but that's a good thing for LexDAO.

From [ethdc.xyz](https://ethdc.xyz) , "ETH DC is organised by DC DAO, the organization for builders in the DC, Maryland and Virginia area."

Unlike ATX DAO or PDX DAO, DC DAO has yet to find its identity. However, I'm confident it will and I was honored to be there during its inaugural event. The panels at the event were very well done, with some impressive thought leaders on stage. Best of luck to Gerald and team as they build out the community!

## DC Blockchain summit, Wednesday May 15 2024

[DAO Coalition](https://www.daocoalition.org) , the LexDAO offshoot that recently got its `501(c)4` status approved and I'm the president of, offered to buy my ticket to this event so I decided to go.

It was a sea of suits. Government and bitcoin, for the most part. But there were many legal and accounting professional services there, most of the booths, so LexDAO is a good fit for these types of events.

I mentioned LexDAO at the event often, advocating for membership whenever I met appropriate professionals.

## conclusion

It was worth going to ETH DC and DC Blockchain Summit. 

I got a soft commit from 2 or 3 people that they would become LexDAO members. It would help if I had stickers or other merch I could give them. Maybe a card that explains the benefits of joining our guild. Also, I don't really have a call to action for people to sign up to our newsletter, which is a much easier ask than membership and could be used as a membership funnel after they sign up and experience some of LexDAO's value-add.

To save money, I stayed with my friend in Baltimore. Traveling from Penn Station to Union Station, and learning about the house my friend just bought, got me thinking about the possibility of a network state enclave in Baltimore.

On Thursday May 16, there was a luncheon at the legislature. There was also a much smaller morning meet and greet with legislators that I was able to get onto the Digital Chamber email list about. However, all that traveling and networking during the first half of the week, and knowing I have a full schedule ahead of me next week teaching a course in Cayman https://www.enterprisecayman.ky/events/cybersandbox-legal-engineering and then heading to MetaCamp https://metacamp.community/ and Edge City thereafter https://www.edgecity.live/ , I decided to skip the 16th legislature visit and catch up on admin work. That day, the Senate sent a clear message to the SEC that its supporting blockchain https://x.com/SenLummis/status/1791181277044875366 so maybe I should have joined the party. At least Gerald was making connections https://x.com/thatgerald/status/1791264918580179445 . 

As with the Stanford and Berkeley events in April https://github.com/lexDAO/LexDAO-Articles/blob/master/Event-Artifacts/2024-05_LexDAO_Event-Artifacts_Futurelaw-and-Earth-Commons_Bestape.md , I felt a wider LexDAO presence -- or spending the funds to stay at a hotel close to the venue -- would make the difference in my decision to skip the last day of the event.
