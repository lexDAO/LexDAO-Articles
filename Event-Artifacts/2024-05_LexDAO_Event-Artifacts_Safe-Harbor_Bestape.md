# Safe Harbor @ Vitalia Roatán, April 2024

###### at Vitalia Dome on *April 28 2024* by Kyle | bestape

## International IP day, April 26 2024

Most of the speakers and a few Vitalians went out to dinner in the West End. I had very productive conversations!

## summit day, April 27 2024

Along with Vitalia.city and Ixian.tech, LexDAO successfully co-hosted the first safe harbor legal engineering summit. At the summit, we explored practical solutions the sandbox sovereign and polycentric legal innovation approach offers to industry.

I was very happy I got to organize a library sciences panel. I feel law librarians are an unrecognized but incredibly important branch of the legal profession -- ripe to bridge computer scientists with legal engineers and all the other types of legal professionals.

The livestream recording is [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/a6IpBejvPus). There will be edited versions in the near future.

Below, where the event was held.

### Christian's opening speech

"Welcome everyone to our Safe Harbor and Legal Engineering Summit for a Bio Crypto Future, brought to you by Vitalia, Ixian, and LexDAO. I want to thank the teams at these organizations for their commitment with this event, specially Victoria, without her none of this would have been possible, Kyle, and of course, Niklas. I also want to thank you, for coming here, and for all the amazing work that you’re doing.

I would want this Summit to be a celebration of your work, of the innovations that you’re bringing to life, and of the development for humanity that comes with them. I would also want this Summit to serve as a Call to Action. 

As we continue to move into the second quarter of the 21st century, our world faces particular challenges for its time, a world where hunger and need are still very present. Yet we know the best practices and institutional changes that would improve that reality, we know about the importance of rule of law and legal security, of accessible and trustworthy governance services. 

That brings us here, to Próspera, and to the broader special economic zone regime in Honduras, these oases of legal stability that could dramatically improve the Country’s conditions. According to Scott Alexander, Próspera ZEDE is the most innovative legal system in the world. And I can attest to that. I live here, and practice here, in the frontier. Here we can design tailored regulations, with direct root access control, enabling good actors to pursue their dreams and bring prosperity. Here you have a blank canvas for proposing good practices that serve cutting edge innovations, as has already been seen with the growing financial and medical industries.

I am convinced that initiatives such as Próspera, such as Vitalia, such as Morazán, such as Catawba, represent the advent of the Network State, they represent an inflection point in social customs and organizational structures. New forms of governance are opportunities for improving institutional conditions worldwide, impacting the quality of life of humanity. 

Many times attorneys have been unsung heroes of social and cultural transformations. Of changes in people's minds and hearts, and the way we interact with each other. Around half of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence in the United States were attorneys. People that put everything on the line for their convictions, people that risked their careers and lives for a better future. We must assume our time in History with the utmost responsibility, and moral urgency. 

And that’s why I’m happy to see such a strong assemble of forward-thinking individuals. Here we are together as a group of pro-technology legal minds, biohackers, and crypto futurists, to continue building the legal foundations of a better future. 

Please stay curious during the Summit, interact with other. I hope you enjoy this experience, and I’m looking forward to seeing what comes out of it, and to seeing your ideas during tomorrow’s pitch competition. The time is now, colleagues, let’s continue building."

## Kyle's closing speech

"It's not by chance that legal code and computer code both share 'code' as their surname. I've learned a lot at this first of hopefully many legal engineering summits to come within one of the first, if not the first, successful network state jurisdictions: Honduras's Próspera ZEDE. Hopefully you feel the same way as I do.

Thank you everyone for attending our Safe Harbor and Legal Engineering Summit for a Bio Crypto Future, brought to you by Vitalia, Ixian and LexDAO. I want to echo Christian's thanks to the teams at these organizations for their commitment to this event, especially Victoria, Christian and Niklas. I also want to thank you again for coming here to this beautiful island paradise Roatán, and for all the amazing work that you do.

I'm happy to report my experience of this Summit has indeed been a celebration of your work, of the innovations that you’re bringing to life, and of the development for humanity that come with them. As far as this Summit being a Call to Action, I'd like to announce that one of the artifacts we'll create from this Summit is to produce articles out of Vitalia YouTube channel's recordings for the first biannual Journal of Legal Engineering, presented by LexDAO. Please be on the lookout for follow-up emails from LexDAO regarding your consent, how you can get involved with the Journal and a special memento POAP celebrating this Summit.

The theme for this first issue of the Journal is privacy and identity, reflecting two of the most important topics we discussed at this Summit. Half the articles in the first issue will follow this theme, but the other half can be about any other high quality academic research, hopefully with industrial applicability. I'm personally excited to work on knowledge and logic trees with Anson and potentially other complexity sensemaking groups we're in early chats with. 

On behalf of LexDAO, I'd love to invite you to become a member of our guild to get more involved in legal engineering or the "law is a public good" movement. Please visit LexDAO.org for more info. We also have great free monthly and weekly newsletters at lexdao.substack.com I highly recommend you sign up for and, if you want to reach the cryptolawyer community, advertise on. 

LexDAO is a nonprofit and relies on donations. For the next week, we're in the Gitcoin matching round, which uses quadratic funding. Please visit lexdaogrant.us to 'vonate' $1 in the round and signal your support for law is a public good. We're in 3 rounds this time so the multiple should be high. You can also vonate to our offshoot organization DAO Coalition, that recently became a 501(c)4 lobby group, just in time for the US elections. Again, please visit lexdaogrant.us for $1 or more to make an outsized impact.

Finally on behalf of LexDAO, in addition to the secret prize Vitalia and Ixian are planning, LexDAO will be giving one of our sold out limited edition premium 'codeslaw is law' hats presented by MetaFactory to the winner of tomorrow's pitch competition! And Joe, don't worry, codeslaw is law is much more humble than its 'code is law' cousin.

We learned a lot at this Summit. Don't worry if you absorbed everything, I didn't. There will be recordings and other artifacts in the future that'll help you integrate. In the meantime, feel free to leave these teachings in the Dome, as we spend the rest of the evening breaking bread together, enjoying each other's company. 

In his opening remarks, Christian rightfully noted that many times attorneys have been the unsung heroes of social and cultural transformations. Lawyers have changed people's minds and hearts, and the way we interact with each other. Around half of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence in the United States were attorneys. Gandhi was an attorney. These were people who put everything on the line for their convictions, people who risked their careers and lives for a better future for themselves and their grandchildren. After attending this Summit, I'm confident lawyers are once again assuming our time in History with the utmost responsibility, and moral urgency, with legal engineers and cryptolawyers leading the charge this time around.

This time around, we are automating the law with deterministic smart contracts, with discretionary artificial intelligence. Arguably, the start of automating the law back in the 70s has already ignited the information age through the legal library sciences that soon matured into the WWW's fundamental interdata and UX protocol known as the HTML document object model. As such, I believe that when attorneys are done transforming society this time around, we won't just experience a new Renaissance -- or the 'regenaissance' as much of web3 calls it -- we'll also get to enjoy a new enlightenment, a prosperity none of us here right now can properly imagine. 

Believing STEAM regimented lawyers will guide us into the dawn of a new enlightenment might seem grandiose, but as Niklas posits, law is the software of society. And as A16Z puts it, software is eating the world. So, since law and software are both code -- same-same but different -- has law already eaten the world? Well, corporations, IP and other relatively recent legal innovations unleashing enough of our latent potential to enter the anthropocene, I'd say, yes, the law aspect of code has already Eaten the World. 

Indeed, Vitalia exists because we believe if we can drastically lower the transaction cost of longevity innovation through thoughtful legal engineering, we'll achieve escape velocity for immortality. Let me repeat that, we might be manifesting right now the enlightenment that finally returns to humanity the holy grail of holy grails.

Good luck everyone in tomorrow's pitch competition! Carpe diem."
