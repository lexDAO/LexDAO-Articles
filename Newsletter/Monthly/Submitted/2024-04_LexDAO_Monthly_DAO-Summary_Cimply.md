## Operations
The Operating Committee has now been meeting consistently every week to discuss strategy and priorities for the DAO since early January.  This reinvigorated group has gone all the way back to our roots to bring the legacy ethos of LexDAO forward.  We are aiming to maintain presence across the web3 community to prioritize LexDAO as a sounding board, thought leader, and engineering powerhouse.  Our primary goals in the first half of this year have been to stabilize the treasury, ensure funding is being allocated to active and promising projects, setting up our progressive decentralization infrastructure, organizing our repositories on GitHub, and determining the extent of LexDAO's software in various outside ecosystems.

Most of this work is slow and steady.  Managing things like membership tokens, tax filings, and other administrative functions while empowering committees across the DAO.  As we start moving into the middle of the year, we will be discussing how to beef up re-emerging activities that show promise for our organization from both a revenue and value-add perspective.

### Key Projects
1. Tax Filings and 501(c6) status
2. Diversified Treasury Allocations of Tokens
3. LexDAO Network Infrastructure through 1155 token map
4. Budget allocations for community initiatives
5. Wallet Network Management and Consolidation
6. Operating System Updates/Refresh
7. Migration of all governance to the new Membership Token by June 30

### Elections
As part of our efforts to continue managing the DAO, GoldenLady has been nominated to join the operating committee.  We encourage members to vote her into an official role once the vote is up on Snapshot.

Our legacy LEETH Holder extrodinaire, Dr. Lau, has put together an excellent Hackathon for our membership to build our appeal to the USPTO for trademark recognition.  As many of your know, the USPTO rejected our initial application and we believe we have the grounds to contest this with strong research and a knack for filing process.  In his words, we are calling our guild of legal engineers and allies to crowdsource a response. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your argumentative skills as its is an administrative appeal without the pressure of a court case. We have previously submitted joint commentary to the Wyoming legislative committees and your name will be attached to the public record at USPTO to show off your ability. As the main goal is to gather evidence (specimens) and craft an argument, it is suited for non-lawyers to get taste of how appeals are written.

## Membership
Membership is the foundation of LexDAO.  We are discussing actively what it means to be a member of this guild to answer questions like:
 - What does it mean to be a contributor?
 - How do we encourage active participation?
 - How do we deliver real value and benefits to members?
 - Who should vote on the future of the DAO?
 - What are the risks to our organization in a pay to play model?

As we ponder these critical questions, we are taking a pragmatic approach to get everyone migrated over to the new token while also attempting to get our legacy members who made this place possible to come forward and re-engage.  Here are some of the main projects we're working on.

### Earned Membership
Our first cohort of Earned Membership applicants are in the pipeline for the first half of 2024.  We had over 10 people raise their hands to contribute to the DAO for a membership token.  Since this program is in its infancy, we are asking for prospects to engage directly and show their interest by *pursuing* projects they are interested in actively.  This means engaging in the Discord, contributing at meetings, and collaborating with their peers.  Here are the suggestions we've put out as areas the DAO needs additional support:

1.  Weekly and Monthly DAO Editorials
 - LexDAO puts out a weekly and monthly newsletter.  The former is more content syndication and summary.  The latter is deeper dives and some information related to what is happening around the DAO.  We could use contributors for both.  If this is something you’re interested in, please go to the “Work for Membership" channel in our discord and tag @comms to express your desire to assist with one or both of these.

2.  Weekly Committee Meeting Notes and Summaries
 - Each week there is a governance/operations, grants, and comms meeting on different days.  We encourage everyone to attend and could use help with compiling summaries of the discussions in our agenda documents.  If anyone has interest in assisting, please tag @ops in the “Work for Membership” thread in Discord.

3.  Hackathon - USPTO Appeal
 - Dr Lau is working on a hackathon where we will be compiling a rebuttal to our recent trademark rejection with the U.S. Patent Office.  Obtaining this trademark is a critical path for the DAO to own its intellectual property and will make for an incredible case study in the wider web3 community.  If you are interested in assisting or participating, please tag @LexEd in the “Work for Membership” thread.

4.  Grants Proposals and Events Opportunities
 - The grants committee is hard at work trying to ensure we have a strong pipeline of incoming grants, strengthening DAO to DAO partnerships, and maintaining a presence at upcoming events around the world  We want to get better organized on what opportunities to pursue and explore.   If you want to participate in helping structure and work this project please tag @grants in the “Work for Membership” thread.

### Membership Drive
We're only about 20 members into our goal of 250 members for the year.  As we've talked about, the DAO will eventually move off the old token standard and will move entirely to the new 721 token.  This means that legacy token holders from 2022 will no longer be able to vote on key initiatives and may lose access to guild channels.  

Help us to encourage adoption of the new token and if you have the resources to pay for a new membership, we ask that you please do so.  Every dollar helps us push our core agenda for 2024 which is "Law is a Public Good".

## Events
### Formal Calendar
We're actively trying to consolidate a key list of events LexDAO needs to be part of.  If you have any thoughts or ideas, please contact @ops in the discord.  This can be for both events we should attend as well as methodologies for compiling a standing calendar.  We welcome your help.

### Codex Sponsorship
LexDAO recently sponsored the Codex event at Stanford University and sent Bestape as a representative to attend, capture, and shill the guild.  This included:
- the Computable Contracts conference at Stanford
- the Institutional Ecologies conference at Stanford
- the Earth Commons (and Funding the Commons) conference at Berkeley

We encourage you to read the summary of the event [here](https://hackmd.io/In0MC4DFTny05H0dALCaZA)

### ETH Denver
At ETH Denver, LexDAO hosted a 6 panel event with MetaCartel at the Gitcoin house.  To ensure members have access to this content, we've started to work on putting a playlist together along with content summaries on YouTube.  The first episode is currently up.  You can also view it on our channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrjJVK9ofHNPBB43RR-hTdA)

## Grants
### GG20
We are currently live with the GG20 Gitcoin grant.  It is a quadratic funding initiative so every dollar has the potential to seriously impact our future.  The grant is open until May 7th.  Please consider donating [here](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/25/108)



## Study Group
### DUNA Session
We had an excellent turnout at our recent DUNA Session with a16z.  Incredible speakers and extremely informative content.  About 20 attendees also minted our POAP which was exciting to see.  If you care to watch the session we've embedded it below.  It can also be watched on our YouTube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUt8N4eMBE8)

### Republic of Marshall Islands Session
We are glad to announce the new study group event which will be about the Republic of Marshall Islands as a jurisdiction where to incorporate crypto projects with LexDAO's friend Adam Miller.
